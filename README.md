Design
The website was designed using the Pencil application.
The files showing the original page designs have been exported from the 
Pencil application and uploaded to the Design files folder. A few 
modifications of the design were made during the implementation phase so 
the designs may not completely accurately reflect the implementation.

Assets
A number of pictures, a video and audio files have been provided by Code 
Institute and these have been included in the website.
